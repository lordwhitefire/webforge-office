/**
 * WebForge Activate Project Tool
 *
 * Called by Hermes when entering a project folder for the first time.
 * Also manages the "active project" — the project WebForge is currently
 * working on. This survives compaction because it's stored in a file.
 *
 * Actions:
 *   - check            — check if a project is activated (uses active-project.txt if no path given)
 *   - activate_new     — create .webforge/ structure in a new project + set as active
 *   - mark_subfolder   — mark this folder as a subfolder of a parent project
 *   - switch_project   — switch the active project to a new path (activates if needed)
 *   - get_active       — return the currently active project path
 *
 * Place in: tool/activate_project.ts (auto-discovered by OpenCode)
