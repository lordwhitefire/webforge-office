/**
 * WebForge Verify Work Tool
 * 
 * Called by SUPERIORS (seniors, leads, directors, heads) to sign off on
 * their subordinate's work. This is the "checks and balances" half.
 * 
 * The superior reads the subordinate's metrics (from report_metrics),
 * runs their tier-specific review checklist, and records a verdict.
 * 
 * If APPROVED: the task can move to "done"
 * If REJECTED: the task goes back to the worker with specific feedback
 * 
 * Sign-offs are stored in .webforge/memory/sign-offs.md
 * 
 * CRITICAL: This tool enforces the verification chain:
 *   Junior → Senior verifies → Lead verifies → Director verifies → Head verifies → Hermes verifies
 * No task is "done" until the full chain signs off.
